Within this work we tried to understand whether a novel method, called multi-task learning, outperform the state-of-the-art models in distinguish cis-regulatory regions across the genome. 

Our works focused on neural networks MTL, in particular hard-parameters sharing approaches (Section~\ref{sec:MTLsection}). A classical feed-forward neural networks (single-task neural networks) was choose as a benchmark (Section~\ref{sec:singletaskNN}). This choice is due to the excellent results in CRRs classification highlighted in previous works. To select the best hyper-parameters configurations of our models a Gaussian Process has been used (Section~\ref{sec:gaussianprocess}).
To train our models, we gathered epigenetic features and regions labels from ENCODE and FANTOM (Section~\ref{sec:epigenomic_data}). We also introduced features selection methods to reduce the large amount of features, especially in some cell lines (Section~\ref{sec:featureselection}). Using these methods we selected two different reduced features sets. 
Analyzing the performance, after running the experimental setups described in Chapter~\ref{cap:experimental_seup}, we obtained very promising results. Note that, the results obtained with both features sets are comparable and does not present significant differences. 

The single-task neural network ability to distinguish cis-regulatory regions is confirmed. In fact, we obtained good results in both considered metrics (Section~\ref{sec:methods_metrics}), in particular with the dataset balanced. Furthermore, our experiments highlight the ability of single-task neural networks to distinguish active promoters and active enhancers (Figure~\ref{fig:unbalanced_old_results} and Figure~\ref{fig:balanced_new_results}).

Our experiments using multi-tasks neural networks models gave very promising results. In many computational tasks, as described in Section~\ref{sec:multi_results} and Section~\ref{sec:results_discussion}, they obtain better results than single-tasks neural networks.
In general, the proposed models result better in distinguish: active enhancers and active promoters from everything else, active promoters from inactive promoters and, finally, inactive enhancer from inactive promoters. In addition, our studies have shown that, also with a MTL setting, a pyramidal structure of the network give better results compared to fixing the size of neurons of every layer. 
Finally, we could notice that reduce the number of tasks (cell lines) involved in the training process improved significantly the performances. 

Despite our works give interesting insight about the fact that multi-task learning neural networks could be a good model for CRRs classification, there is still a lot of work to be done. In particular, we suggest to try others MTL approaches not considered in this work. Both neural networks based, such as soft-parameters sharing, or non-neural models. In addition, some efforts can be dedicated in studying an approach for understand how much the cell lines are related. Probably, training multi-task learning models with highly related tasks lead to better performance.

The importance of recognizing regulatory elements across human DNA, due to the serious health implications in misregulation of genes, and the promising results the we obtained in our investigations makes us believe that continuing research in that direction can bring very important results.
